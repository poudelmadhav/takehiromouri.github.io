title: My Approach to Achieving Deep Focus
---

If you ever want to get good at something, I’m a firm believer of going into what I like to call <strong>“Zen Mode”</strong>. Some people call it <i>“the state of flow”</i>, some people call it <i>“deep focus”</i>, other people call it other things.

I get the most things done when I’m in my Zen Mode.

<strong>If I’m not in my Zen Mode, I’m distracted, I’m unfocused, and I’m wasting my time.</strong>

# First I ask myself: Do I like what I’m doing? 

First things first, I find that <strong>if I don’t like what I’m learning or doing, I’m never able to enter Zen Mode.</strong>

So if I’m trying to enter Zen Mode in something I just don’t enjoy or care about, then <strong>I’m a strong believer in picking up something else instead.</strong>

# Locking Myself Up = Deep Focus

One of my friends who I consider to be a genius mathematician once told me this:

<i>"The only way you can improve on things is to lock yourself up in a room and practice."</i>

This might be a super asian way of thinking of things (I'm asian) — <strong>BUT</strong> it has a lot of truths to it, especially if it’s a skill set in which individual work is important.

How does one become a great artist? A great engineer?

<strong>Most likely through hours of practice alone.</strong>

Whenever I’m trying to improve a skill, often times the best bet is to really immerse myself in the activity.

And <strong>to immerse myself in the activity, I can’t have other people around me, or have other distractions.</strong>

## But it’s difficult when you have friends, social pressures, and obligations.

<strong>It’s also hard to say no.</strong>

It was personally difficult for me to turn down invitations from my friends to go out and get drunk — <strong>but after my mathematician friend gave me his perspective, it made me feel fine about not always going out or being social.</strong>

Social pressures can work for people or it can work against people. Since my friend encouraged me to feel okay about being a nerd, I've encouraged my friends to do so as well.

This kind of creates an eco system where our group of friends can freely be nerds and be okay about it, and it works great.

If you're one of these people or want to make yourself feel better about being a nerd, please do message me and I will be super happy of making another hardworking nerdy friend.
