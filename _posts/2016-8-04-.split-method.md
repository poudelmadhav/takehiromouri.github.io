title: .split method
---

<p>
  I've had some students ask me about the <code>.split</code> method in ruby :D
</p>

<p>
  Here's a brief rundown of how it works. Hopefully the examples do a good job of explaining what it does :)
</p>  

{% highlight ruby %}
momos = "I love momos"
momos.split(" ")
# => ["I", "love", "momos"]
# returns an array of strings seperated by " "

string_2 = "A, bc, def, ghi"
string_2.split(",")
# => ["A", " bc", " def", " ghi"]
# here, we are splitting the array with ","
# then we are storing them in an array

string_3 = "abcdefgabcdefg"
string_3.split("a")
# => ["", "bcdefg", "bcdefg"]
# here, we are splitting the array by "a", so we get this result
{% endhighlight %}
